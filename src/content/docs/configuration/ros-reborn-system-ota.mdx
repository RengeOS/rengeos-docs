title: ROS-Reborn-System-OTA (Recovery Mode)
---

**Imagine** you're too lazy to download the latest **RengeOS ISO**, but your system is running **RengeOS** and ``Recovery Mode`` is **enabled**.
Why not take advantage of the ``ros-reborn`` tool?
<br />
**Essentially**, this is a supplementary tool to the ``ros-reborn`` tool that allows updating airootfs and the kernel in ``Recovery Mode`` based
on the latest **RengeOS** version available here: https://github.com/RengeOS/ROS-Reborn-System-OTA/releases/latest
<br />
**Thanks to this**, you will always save a lot of time installing the latest RengeOS and won't need a Live ISO or USB, which is also the purpose for which this tool was created:D

## Let’s proceed
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Aside type="note">
**Note that** this process requires a **network connection**,
  so make sure you are connected to the network via **LAN** or **wirelessly** using the ``nmtui`` command.  
</Aside>

- **First**, boot into ``Recovery Mode`` from the ``GRUB menu``, then log in as the **root user**.
- **Then** enter the command ``ros-reborn-system-ota`` and you see this program.

## Download airootfs and kernels from latest RengeOS
- **Next**, confirm if you want to continue and we will proceed with the process of
  downloading airootfs and the kernel from the latest GitHub release for RengeOS.

<Aside type="note">
 **This process** will not change anything to airootfs and the current kernel in the ``/rengeos-reborn`` directory, so you will be safe.

|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

## Update airootfs and the kernels from latest RengeOS
- **After** the download is complete, we will choose between updating airootfs and kernels in the ``/rengeos-reborn`` directory
  (where they are located so that ``ros-reborn`` tool can reinstall the system without using a Live ISO and USB).
- **If** you select **Yes**, the process will proceed to delete airootfs and the old kernels, replacing them with the new ones.
- **If** you select **No**, airootfs and kernels will remain unchanged and nothing will happen.

<Aside type="note">
 **The information** inside the image below is a bit messy, so please make sure you've checked
 for the latest version here: https://github.com/RengeOS/ROS-Reborn-System-OTA/releases/latest
</Aside>

## After the update process is complete
- **If** you successfully update airootfs and the kernel, you will see this message
  and **congratulations**, you have successfully updated airootfs and kernels for the ``ros-reborn`` tool, yay!
- **Now** you can use the ros-reborn tool, and it can definitely reinstall the system based on airootfs and the kernels you've updated:D

## Hi, I’m **[Phú]** A Linux Enthusiast 🐧

- I am a programmer from Vietnam who enjoys building and learning new technologies in the process. I am currently in my final year at Le Hong Phong High School btw.<br />
- You can see the project here. This isn't my first project,
  but my goal in creating it was to make it something cool and helpful in specific situations, such as rescuing outdated computers,
  providing performance from the first use without extensive setup,
  easy system maintenance, and handling complex external tasks, etc.
- My dream is simply to be recognized, that's all :)
